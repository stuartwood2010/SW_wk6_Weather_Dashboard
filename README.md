I utilized the week 6 activities folder, google, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array, and https://www.w3schools.com/js/. 

## Description
I created a weather dashboard, where a user is able to search for the weather in specific cities, based on the user input. The user also saves their viewed cities for easier access in the future. 
The weather info is collected from the Open Weather one call API.
